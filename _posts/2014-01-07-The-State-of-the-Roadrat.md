excerpt: The bicycle I built.

This is how my [Cotic](https://www.cotic.co.uk/) Roadrat (or Off-Roadrat as I refer to it) is looking these days. It's set up for on and off-road riding, can carry a fair amount of gear, and is really fun to ride.

The brakes are a weird combo of Tektro cantilevers at the front and an Avid BB5 on the back. It used to have an Avid BB7 at the front, but I had to change to rim brakes when I wanted a dyno-hub on the front. I *was* intending to build a new front wheel using a Shimano hub with a disc brake mount, but when the hub arrived I noticed that because the Roadrat fork puts the disc brake on the right-front of the fork rather than the rear-left, the hub would be running backwards. I have emailed Shimano tech support to ask if this is a problem, but haven't heard back yet.

The front wheel (Shimano DH-3N80 dynamo hub on a Mavic A319 rim) is one I bought fully built from [Rose Bikes](https://www.roseversand.de/) in Germany, and the rear is a Shimano Deore hub on a Velocity Dyad rim, which I built myself. The tyres are the excellent [Bruce Gordon Rock n' Roads](https://www.bgcycles.com/rock-n-road-tire.html). They're surprisingly fast on the road and fantastic on gravel, grass and mud, providing lots of grip and a smooth ride.

The crankset is a Stronglight Impact. I bought this from [XXCycle](]https://www.xxcycle.com/) in France. I like the Stronglights because they are simple, good quality, fairly cheap, and they have a great selection of sizes. You can choose singles, doubles, triples, and with all different combinations of teeth & crank length. And, they're silver (I really don't like black bicycle components).

The handlebars are Salsa Cowbell 3s. These are fairly wide, have a shallow drop, and flare slightly outwards. Not especially aerodynamic but very comfortable. The front derailleur is a Shimano 105 and the rear is a Shimano Deore, both secondhand. They are operated by Shimano Ultegra bar-end shifters. The brake levers are Tektro.

The saddle is a Brooks Flyer and the front rack is a Nitto M-12. On the back is a Planet-Bike Versa Rack Disc. Hanging off the front of the Nitto is a B&M Eyc light.

The bag on the front? Made that myself (hence the dodgy sewing). There is a padded compartment on the left for my camera, and a map pocket on the lid.

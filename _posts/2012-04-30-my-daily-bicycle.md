excerpt: The bicycle I built.

I read somewhere that in the Finnish language there is a specific word (*Poronkusema*) for the distance equal to how far a reindeer can travel without a "comfort break". I wish there was a similarly useful word in English to describe the situation where you want something, but when you go looking for it you can only find a million varieties of that thing - *that you don't like at all*. This happens to me all the time. Writers in a gentler age would have called me *particular*. Writers of this age would call me *a wanker*. Unless they were American - in America a *wanker* is a type of *fannypack*. Interestingly enough, I knew someone who was travelling in the US some years ago and they met a guy who's name was Randy Wanker. *Really*.

So anyway, a couple of years ago I decided I was going to cycle around the place instead of driving, and went looking for a suitable bike. I couldn't find one and decided to build my own. This is what I made.

![Bike](https://aucklandbikeslob.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/04/r0011914.jpg)

The frame is a [Cotic Roadrat](https://www.cotic.co.uk/product/roadrat), and the rest of the bike is put together from parts made by [Velocity](https://www.velocitywheels.com/), [Sturmey Archer](https://www.sturmey-archer.com/), [Brooks](https://www.brooksengland.com/), [Sapim](https://www.sapim.be/), [Tange-Seiki](https://www.tangeseiki.com/), [Michelin](https://www.michelinbicycletire.com/michelinbicycle/), [Jagwire](https://www.jagwireusa.com/) and [Shimano](https://www.shimano.com/)

It's not perfect - there are no mudguards and the rear basket is a bit crap. But it's practical enough to be my primary means of transport - I ride it to work and everywhere else around the city (including to [synchronised cycling](https://www.velociteers.com/) practices and performances).

It has a front light powered by a large rechargeable battery...

3-speed gears...

Comfortable handlebars...

Front & rear hub brakes...

It also has a rear light attached to the carrier and some fat tyres. These days there are some more options when it comes to buying city bikes, you've got [Velo-Ideale](https://www.velo-ideale.com/) and [Rode](https://rode.co.nz/) for instance. But I think a good point to remember is, if you can't find what you want, you can always go & make it yourself. And if the project turns in to a *Vortex of Damnation*, well then at least you'll know not to do it again..

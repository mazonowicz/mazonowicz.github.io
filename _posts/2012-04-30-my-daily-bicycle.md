I read somewhere that in the Finnish language there is a specific word (<em>Poronkusema</em>) for the distance equal to how far a reindeer can travel without a "comfort break". I wish there was a similarly useful word in English to describe the situation where you want something, but when you go looking for it you can only find a million varieties of that thing - <em>that you don't like at all</em>. This happens to me all the time. Writers in a gentler age would have called me <em>particular</em>. Writers of this age would call me <em>a</em> <em>wanker</em>. Unless they were American - in America a <em>wanker</em> is a type of <em>fannypack</em>. Interestingly enough, I knew someone who was travelling in the US some years ago and they met a guy who's name was Randy Wanker. <em>Really</em>.

So anyway, a couple of years ago I decided I was going to cycle around the place instead of driving, and went looking for a suitable bike. I couldn't find one and decided to build my own. This is what I made.

The frame is a <a href="http://www.cotic.co.uk/product/roadrat">Cotic Roadrat</a>, and the rest of the bike is put together from parts made by  <a href="http://www.velocitywheels.com/">Velocity</a>, <a href="http://www.sturmey-archer.com/">Sturmey Archer</a>, <a href="http://www.brooksengland.com/">Brooks</a>, <a href="http://www.sapim.be/">Sapim</a>, <a href="http://www.tangeseiki.com/">Tange-Seiki</a>, <a href="http://www.michelinbicycletire.com/michelinbicycle/">Michelin</a>, <a href="http://www.jagwireusa.com/">Jagwire</a> and <a href="http://www.shimano.com/">Shimano</a>

It's not perfect - there are no mudguards and the rear basket is a bit crap. But it's practical enough to be my primary means of transport - I ride it to work and everywhere else around the city (including to <a href="http://www.velociteers.com/">synchronized cycling</a> practices and performances).

It has a front light powered by a large rechargeable battery...

3-speed gears...

Comfortable handlebars...

Front & rear hub brakes...

It also has a rear light attached to the carrier and some fat tyres. These days there are some more options when it comes to buying city bikes, you've got <a href="http://www.velo-ideale.com/">Velo-Ideale</a> and <a href="http://rode.co.nz/">Rode</a> for instance. But I think a good point to remember is, if you can't find what you want, you can always go & make it yourself. And if the project turns in to a <em>Vortex of Damnation</em>, well then at least you'll know not to do it again.]]>

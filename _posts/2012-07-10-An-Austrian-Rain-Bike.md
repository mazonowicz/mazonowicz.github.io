excerpt: A cheap, weird European bike I found and fixed up.

In a previous post, I referred to my Cotic Roadrat as my "Everyday Bicycle". I also mentioned it's lack of mudguards. So when it scarcely stopped raining in Auckland - "The Seattle of the South Pacific" - for a couple of weeks, I assembled a different "Everyday Bicycle". One **with** mudguards. Let me introduce The Puch.

It's not an especially pretty bike, although it probably was back in the 1970s when it came out of the Puch factory in Austria. I spotted this particular vehicle on a well-known local Internet auction site and arranged to purchase it for the very reasonable sum of $10. There was *some* work required - I replaced the handlebars, wheels, front brake, brake levers and derailleur.

As a general purpose bike it has some shortcomings - the chain has a tendency to fall off if I change too quickly in to a higher gear, and the actual levers are placed, not very conveniently, at arms-length. And then there's all that.. ahem.. rust.

But The Puch also has some excellent qualities - the aforementioned mudguards, a surprisingly comfortable riding position and a pair of very nice Schwalbe Marathon Racer tyres.

And... a dynamo powered headlamp.

The lights were also an addition of mine. They are made by [Busch+Muller](https://www.bumm.de/). The headlight has a facility called a standlight - meaning that it stores a bit of charge from the dynamo, so that when you are stopped at traffic lights, the headlight stays on for a few minutes. It doesn't produce an enormous amount of light, but it's enough to see by if I find myself in an area without streetlights. Thanks to the dynamo, I don't have to worry my pretty little head about batteries, and it makes a pleasantly loud whirring noise that warns pedestrians and frightens dogs.
